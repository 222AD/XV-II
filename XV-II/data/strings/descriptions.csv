dxvotkta,SHIP,"Heavily armed warship of the Xevlaoctven Navy. Heavily armored veclotain platings allows it to take a large beating. This is normally used in combat and also pontentally for trading. However, the material required for such a ship is far higher than what even standard planets can make, let alone make such a advanced material.",Super Battleship-class vessel,,,
uklvoatovor,SHIP,"While not many of these ships exist, they are more than often far powerful than the standard ships in this universe. Ships fall due to it's firepower and if a person sees one, they must run or accept defeat.  However, like the Dxvotkta Super Battleship, this is awfully expensive to build due to very strong materals(similar of that to the Dxvotkta Super Battleship) from an another universe.


This ship has extoutium armor, allowing it to survive lots of heavy hits at the cost of extreme weight. In spite of this, it can move like a capital ship which is a bit fast for it's size.",,,,
stvforva,SHIP,"A Reptech Cargoship. This is one of the main means of transporting goods, fuel, and troops to resupply/repair and invade respectively. While fragile, they make up for speed. Some large ships are unable to catch up to it while small ships simply can't actually strip it's arm or to the point where it can be destroyed. 

It's dimensional cargo holds allows for it to store a lot more cargo than what conventional cargo ships can possibly hold. It's also capable of defending ships from  a large range with it's PD weapons, though it's very inefficient to do so.",,,,
revlogvortora,SHIP,"A frigate armored with durable light heblovium panels. These panels are lightweight, thus allowing the frigate to move fast. While it may not take as much punishment as a super battleship, it's still dangerous and may pose a threat to fleets that dare come near it.

It's capable of handling armaments no frigate could, causing it to have awesome firepower if used correctly.",,,,
