dxvotkta,SHIP,"Heavily armed warship of the Xevlaoctven Navy. Heavily armored veclotain platings allows it to take a large beating. This is normally used in combat and also pontentally for trading. However, the material required for such a ship is far higher than what even standard planets can make, let alone make such a advanced material.",,,,
uklvoatovor,SHIP,"While not many of these ships exist, they are more than often far powerful than the standard ships in this universe. Ships fall due to it's firepower and if a person sees one, they must run or accept defeat.  However, like the Dxvotkta Super Battleship, this is awfully expensive to build due to very strong materals(similar of that to the Dxvotkta Super Battleship) from an another universe.


This ship has extoutium armor, allowing it to survive lots of heavy hits at the cost of extreme weight. In spite of this, it can move like a capital ship which is a bit fast for it's size.",,,,
stvforva,SHIP,"A Reptech Cargoship. This is one of the main means of transporting goods, fuel, and troops to resupply/repair and invade respectively. While fragile, they make up for speed. Some large ships are unable to catch up to it while small ships simply can't actually strip it's arm or to the point where it can be destroyed. 

It's dimensional cargo holds allows for it to store a lot more cargo than what conventional cargo ships can possibly hold. It's also capable of defending ships from  a large range with it's PD weapons, though it's very inefficient to do so.",,,,
revlogvortora,SHIP,"A frigate armored with durable light heblovium panels. These panels are lightweight, thus allowing the frigate to move fast. While it may not take as much punishment as a super battleship, it's still dangerous and may pose a threat to fleets that dare come near it.

It's capable of handling armaments no frigate could, causing it to have awesome firepower if used correctly.",,,,
orkovtrva,SHIP,"A missile cruiser. These ships also have durable light heblovium panels; the same as the young revlogvortora frigate designs. While it can easily destroy ships from a long range, it's just as easily vunerable as a cargo ship at such a short range. Howerver, the panels of this ship is greatly reinforced and can take a large amount of damage before the hull will be breached, allowing it to retreat in case of enemy ships attacking it. This is one of many of the advanced reptech ship designs.",,,,
azorva,SHIP,"A reptech shield ship. These type of ships are capable of withstanding all but the most brutal forms of attack with it's shield. In case of a flank, it's heavy veclotain armor platings allow it to withstand severe punishment even from flagships long enough to recover. This sadly, reduces amount of weapons that can be placed on the ship itself and thus, reducing the amount of firepower it can possibly dish out. In spite of this, the hull itself is reinforced with zentotium bulkheads, greatly increasing the amount of punishment the hull can take if the armor is breached.",,,,
