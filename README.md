# XV-II
Adds some impossibly strong ships. (WIP)


These ships are purposely overpowered on their own due to their high stats... But they are extremely rare to find. Of course, if you get silly and manage to lose one of them... Too bad, build an another one!
If you have at least one of these ships(except for the frigate, it's weak on it's own. Don't question why.), you can expect the enemy fleets running away from you!

I'm planning to make this endgame content. If you have any ideas, I'm glad to accept.
